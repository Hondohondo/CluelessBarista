1. Models (to know exactly how to handle different data types...)

2. Repository (necessary for JPA, to access data in our database)

3. Controller (where we build controllers) - package for implementation and package for interfaces (optional). A controller is a java class that has methods to handle API requests
-

4. In the service is where we have complex logic for the controllers.


===
1. Once springboot knows which database to work from using application.properties file, we need models...for spring to know how to interact with different properties.

2. Model is telling spring to look for a table with a "Teacher" name, and knows that through Annotation @Entity
- Looks for that exact name but in lower case (spring boot do this via @entity)
- our entity is already linked to database table through the entity annotation
- Spring needs to know what is happening in each table, what data structures are in that table. We do this using models

3. If we want to retrieve information we create repositories. We create repository and add anotation @repository
- and we use jpa by extending the repository (Jpa handles everything for us)

4. We create controllers to access the database via the API
